Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.

Installation

Running Locally

npm start
This will launch the app in development mode—typically at http://localhost:3000/. Changes you make will auto-reload the browser.

Building for Production

npm run build
This compiles the React app into optimized, minified static files in the build/ folder.

Deployment
The app is hosted on Netlify. To deploy updates:

Netlify will automatically build and deploy from the main (or configured) branch.

Alternatively, you can manually deploy the build/ folder using Netlify CLI or drag-and-drop.
